Machine Learning at Berkeley partnered with Unity Technologies to apply ML methods toward de-lighting surface texture.

## Background

Realistic in-game objects are often captured from the real world through a process called photogrammetry. Photogrammetry involves capturing images of all angles of an object (e.g. a rock) and then reconstructing the object from those images with 3D reconstruction techniques. **De-lighting** is necessary to remove the effect of non-uniform real world lighting and shadow on the object, so that the object can be re-lit by lighting within the game environment.
